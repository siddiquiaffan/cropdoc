  "Disease": "Early blight (EB) is a disease of potato caused by the fungus Alternaria solani. It is found wherever potatoes are grown.",
  "Symptoms": [
    "The disease first becomes visible as small, isolated, scattered, pale brown spots on the leaflets. The lowest leaves are attacked first and the disease progresses upwards.",
    "In the necrotic spots, concentric rings appear on older leaves and darkened areas on the stem. This gives a target board- like effect. There is usually a narrow chlorotic zone around the spots.",
    "There may be a few spots or a large numbers of spots on the leaves.",
    "In dry weather, the spots become hard and the leaves curl.",
    "In humid weather, the affected areas increase and large rotting patches may appear."
  ],
  "Spread": [
    "The pathogen is mainly air borne.",
    "The primary infection may be through tubers.",
    "The mycelium and conidia of the fungus remains dormant in dry infected leaves for a year or more.",
    "Collateral hosts such as tomato play an important role in the perpetuation and dissemination of the pathogen.",
    "The climate as temperature and abundant moisture and soil exert a considerable influence on the development of the disease."
  ],
  "Management": [
    "Plant only diseasefree, certified seed.",
    "Follow a complete and regular foliar fungicide spray program.",
    "Practice good killing techniques to lessen tuber infections.",
    "Allow tubers to mature before digging, dig when vines are dry, not wet, and avoid excessive wounding of potatoes during harvesting and handling.",
    "Plow underall plant debris and volunteer potatoes after harvest."
