        "Since many tomato pathogens live in the soil, plant tomatoes in a different spot in the garden each year.",
        "Don’t work in the garden when tomato foliage is wet or you may inadvertently spread pathogens from plant to plant.",
        "Pinch off leaves with any signs of disease immediate and dispose of them in the trash to keep a possible infection from spreading.",
        "Provide adequate air circulation around each plant. Here’s our guide to spacing tomatoes properly.",
        "Disinfect the empty pots if you grow your tomatoes in containers, using a 10% bleach solution at the end of the growing season and replace the spent potting soil with a new mix every spring."
