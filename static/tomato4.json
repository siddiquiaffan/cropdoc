  ],
  "Spread": [

    "Conidia through rain splash or wind and also by slimy conidia sticking on to hands and clothing of tomato pickers"
  ],
  "Management": [
    "If caught early, the lower infected leaves can be removed and burned or destroyed.",
    "If the plants can still be handled without breaking them, stake or cage the plants to raise them off the ground and promote faster drying of the foliage.",
    "Overhead watering facilitates infection and spreads the disease. Use a soaker hose at the base of the plant to keep the foliage dry. Water early in the day.",
    "Nightshade and horsenettle are frequently hosts of Septoria leaf spot and should be eradicated around the garden site."
